            <span class="bandname">Men I Trust </span> was founded in 2014 by high school friends <span class="member">Jessy Caron</span> and <span class="member">Dragos Chiriac</span>, who reunited in the music department at Université Laval. They released a self-titled EP in 2014 and later performed at the Montreal Jazz Festival, Quebec City Summer Festival, and M for Montreal. They released the album Headroom in 2015. They were later joined by the twenty-three year old <span class="member">Emma Proulx</span>, a singer and guitarist that has participated full-time in the group since March 2016. The band toured in China, playing shows in Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai. In 2017 <span class="bandname">Men I Trust</span> released the single "I Hope to Be Around" with an accompanying music video.

            From 2016 to 2019, they released twelve singles. Eight of them were reworked and included in their next album. They released the album Oncle Jazz on September 13, 2019. In a conversation with writer Nick Fulton for the music publication Billboard, the band noted that the green, solitary confines of rural Quebec were influential in shaping how the album sounded. "It put us in a really different creative mood and we were able to focus more, because there’s nothing to do outside of the house except for walking and thinking about music,” said singer and guitarist <span class="member">Emma Proulx</span>.
